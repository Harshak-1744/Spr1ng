## CRUD Operations in Spring Boot

This project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building web applications. CRUD operations are the basic operations performed on data in most software applications.


## Technologies:
- Java: The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- Spring Boot: A Java framework used for creating standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- MySQL: A popular relational database management system used for storing and retrieving data.

  
## Tools:
- Spring Tool Suite (STS) or any preferred Java IDE: Used for writing, debugging, and running the Java code.
- MySQL Workbench or any preferred MySQL client: Used for managing the MySQL database, creating tables, and executing SQL queries.
- Postman: An API development and testing tool used for testing RESTful APIs and interacting with web services.


## Dependencies:
The project's dependencies are managed using Maven, a popular build and dependency management tool for Java projects. The dependencies listed in the `pom.xml` file include:

- `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`: Provides dependencies for working with Spring Data JPA, enabling database operations using Java Persistence API (JPA) standards.
- `spring-boot-starter-web`: Provides dependencies for building web applications with Spring MVC, allowing the creation of RESTful APIs or web interfaces.
- `mysql-connector-java`: The MySQL JDBC driver that enables the application to connect and interact with the MySQL database.
- `spring-boot-starter-test`: Provides dependencies for testing the Spring Boot application, including unit tests and integration tests.

Please note that the actual versions of the dependencies may vary depending on the project's specific requirements and the version specified in the `pom.xml` file.

It's important to ensure that you have the necessary JDK, IDE, and database tools installed and configured properly to work with the project.
