# Step-wise Break down of Entity Class

## Step 1: Package Declaration
```java
package com.example.demo.entity;
```
- In this step, we declare the package for the `Student` class. The package name is `com.example.demo.entity`.

## Step 2: Import Statements
```java
import jakarta.persistence.Entity;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;
```
- In this step, we import the necessary classes for the `Student` class. We import `Entity` and `Id` from the `jakarta.persistence` package.

## Step 3: Class Declaration
```java
@Entity
public class Student {
    // Class code goes here...
}
```
- In this step, we declare the `Student` class using the `class` keyword. The class is marked with the `@Entity` annotation.

## Step 4: Field Declarations
```java
@Id
private int rollNo;
private String name;
private String Address;
```
- In this step, we declare the fields of the `Student` class. It has three fields: `rollNo` of type `int`, `name` of type `String`, and `Address` of type `String`. The `rollNo` field is annotated with `@Id` to indicate it as the primary key.

## Step 5: Constructors
```java
public Student() {
    // Default constructor code goes here...
}

public Student(int rollNo, String name, String address) {
    // Parameterized constructor code goes here...
}
```
- In this step, we define the constructors for the `Student` class. It has a default constructor with no arguments and a parameterized constructor that accepts the `rollNo`, `name`, and `address` as arguments.

## Step 6: Getter and Setter Methods
```java
public int getRollNo() {
    // Getter code for rollNo goes here...
}

public void setRollNo(int rollNo) {
    // Setter code for rollNo goes here...
}

public String getName() {
    // Getter code for name goes here...
}

public void setName(String name) {
    // Setter code for name goes here...
}

public String getAddress() {
    // Getter code for Address goes here...
}

public void setAddress(String address) {
    // Setter code for Address goes here...
}
```
- In this step, we define the getter and setter methods for the fields of the `Student` class. Each getter method returns the value of the corresponding field, and each setter method sets a new value for the corresponding field.

## Step 7: `toString()` Method
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Student [rollNo=" + rollNo + ", name=" + name + ", Address=" + Address + "]";
}
```
- In this step, we override the `toString()` method inherited from the `Object` class. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the `Student` object, including the values of the `rollNo`, `name`, and `Address` fields.

# Note 
Certainly! In Spring Tool Suite (STS) and other IDEs, you can generate the constructors, getters and setters, and `toString()` method with just a few clicks. Here's how you can do it in STS:

1. After declaring the private variables in your entity class, right-click inside the class and select "Source" from the context menu.

2. In the "Source" menu, select "Generate Getters and Setters" to generate the getter and setter methods for all the private variables. You can choose the variables you want to generate methods for or select all of them.

3. Similarly, in the "Source" menu, select "Generate Constructor using Fields" to generate a constructor that accepts all the private variables as arguments.

4. Finally, in the "Source" menu, select "Generate toString()" to generate the `toString()` method that provides a string representation of the object, including the values of the private variables.

By using these options, you can quickly generate the necessary constructors, getters and setters, and `toString()` method in your entity class without writing the code manually.
